# spuria

Mini API server for executing bash on a remote server.  
The executable is only ~2MB in size (after using upx) and allows for IP whitelisting and prometheus "up" monitoring.  
Security is granted by IP whitelisting and calls/minute limits. It uses no external packages, only inbuilt golang ones.

There are 4 main HTTP codes used:

 - 200 ; successful execution of bash
 - 500 ; failed execution of bash
 - 404 ; URL not found
 - 429 ; if the ratelimit of an URL is reached


# Usecases

This was written for old servers who run on bare metal and have poorly written "order of startup" distributed servers code.  
Example:

An old java application runs on 3 different servers, but they have to be started in the correct order. This means you have to manually log in to all 3 servers and apply commands to each one, waiting until each one has started before going to the next server.  
With this application you could have 3 URLs on each server labeled `/status`, `/start` and `/stop`. This way you could remotely start/stop a service on a remote server and coordinate the startup/shutdown order from a central "main server" without having to implement a new framework / management layer.

Another use case would be a very old infrastructure where servers communicate by automatically logging in via SSH and executing bash scripts on other servers.  
With this small application you could easily replace old/insecure APIs that use (for example) SSH with a simple and secure HTTP based one.


# Usage

By default the application logs to stdout, listens on port 4870 and listens only on IP `127.0.0.1` (and only allows connections from `127.0.0.1`).  
The log is in the "logfmt" format, which can be parsed by Grafana Loki and other logging tools.  
To start it you have to provide a command to be executed. Examples:  

```bash
# This will listen on /do and print out "hi" with http code 200
./spuria -returnresult -cmd "echo 'hi'"
# This will listen on the configured routes /test and /test2 and create files if accessed
./spuria -routes routes.example.csv
```

You can also make it more dynamic and not only execute static bash scripts.  
If you provide the `-replaceparam` flag then GET parameters will be used inside the bash script.  
Only GET parameters starting with a $ will have their param name replaced with the value inside the command.  
If you send a POST request the body of the request will replace the `$body` variable inside the command.
Only POST and GET requests are allowed.
Example:

```bash
# Start the service with -replaceparam and have a $ variable in your script
# The example routes file has a /test3 route with $parm1 and $parm2 variables
./spuria -replaceparam -routes routes.example.csv
# Send a request to /test3 with the parameters, if not present the values won't be replaced
# We need to escape the $ here (with \$) because otherwise it would be replaced before execution, in your browser you wouldn't need the forwardslashes
curl "http://localhost:4870/test3?\$parm1=ReplacedText&\$parm2=AnotherReplacedText"
# Check the test3.txt file for your new output file
$ cat test3.txt
# newline
# ReplacedText
# AnotherReplacedText
# here
```

Full help output:

```
$ ./spuria --help
Usage of ./spuria:
  -allowedips 1.1.1.1,3.3.3.3
        which ips to respond to in a comma-sep list, e.g. 1.1.1.1,3.3.3.3 (set to "" to disable) (default "127.0.0.1")
  -cmd "echo 'hi'"
        static command to execute for /do , e.g. "echo 'hi'" , if this is set no csv (-routes) will be loaded
  -ip string
        which ip to listen on (default "127.0.0.1")
  -log ./spuria.log
        where to log to, e.g. ./spuria.log (default "stdout")
  -maxratelimit int
        requests allowed per URL per minute, 0 = infinite (default 10)
  -nostop
        do not stop when encountering an error in the parameter replacement
  -port int
        port to listen on (default 4870)
  -replaceparam
        replace GET parameters starting with $ inside the bash script, POST body will be replacing $body
  -replaceregex string
        regex for allowed parameter replacing characters (default "^[ a-zA-Z0-9/-]*$")
  -returnresult
        returns the command output in the http response, default is OK/ERR for 200/500 response body
  -routes ./routes.csv
        bash commands file to load, e.g. ./routes.csv
```


# Build

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags '-w -s' .
# To make it smaller also do:
upx --best spuria
```

This will make the executable static and smaller thanks to upx (from 5.6MB to 1.9MB in my case).  
I read that upx may impact the startup time but in my test cases it was barely noticable if at all visible.


## Install upx

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your path.

```bash
cd ~/.local/bin
wget https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/download/v4.2.2/upx-4.2.2-amd64_linux.tar.xz
tar -xvf upx-4.2.2-amd64_linux.tar.xz
rm upx-4.2.2-amd64_linux.tar.xz
mv upx-4.2.2-amd64_linux/upx .
rm upx-4.2.2-amd64_linux/
```
